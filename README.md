# OutlookSenderStatistics
This Windows program automates Microsoft Outlook to get the number of emails from each sender address. You can then specify which senders to bulk delete from your mailbox.

The binary release requires Microsoft Outlook and .Net 8.0. The code can probably compiled to run on legacy .Net 4, but I haven't tested.
